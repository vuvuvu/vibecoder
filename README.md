## The Future of Coding... IS VIBE CODING!

Produced 100% by vibecoding, Vibecoder marks the end of programming as we know it. Just like the rise of sports betting, coding has taken a turn for the chill. In 2025, as uncertainty looms, vibecoding provides a sanctuary. If you don't like what you get, just respin!

***Spins are not free, they cost tokens.***
